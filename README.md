First portfolio was a temporary design to get up online quickly. Intention was always to replace it with a more customized site.

# Why did I use react/JS?

-Components allow for easy additions and changes to sections

-Easy ecosystem to deal with

-Single page layout was fine, database/API wasn't needed.

-Had no React projects to put in my portfolio!

v2 is built in React, Javascript, CSS3. Also used reactjs-popup for the modal/tooltip functionality.

Ran into trouble with getting external links to individual Heroku sites. Solution was to use reactjs-popup to create a modal menu with links to each Heroku site.
