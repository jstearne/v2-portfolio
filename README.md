First portfolio was a temporary design to get up online quickly. Intention was always to replace it with a more customized site.

Decided to use React for multiple reasons:

Had no React projects to put in my portfolio
Components allow for easy additions and changes to sections
Easy ecosystem to deal with
Single page app was fine, database/API wasn't needed

v2 is built in React, Javascript, CSS3. 

Would like to add tooltips to icons for easy readability in the future. Also need to connect github links to individual repos. 
Will likely use conditionals or hooks to do that.

Tooltips/git links are low priority for now. Have to get back to the job hunt!
